# Gov-numbers
A searchable list of government contact info. Can be searched by name, state, title, gender, or area code.

This is the jumping off point for an app that allows users to get notifications about relevant government official to contact based on the users interests and upcoming votes. 

I used the Govtrack API to pull the current contact information and made that information searchable with certain criteria. 
The initial implementation is using stored data as the govtrack api will be changing this summer.
Once the new API is in place all contact information will be pulled from the most current information.

This project is full-stack with future versions to focus on frontend usablitiy. 
The site was developed using vanilla Javascript for the frontend and Node, Express, and Mongo on the backend.

All public work can be found at https://github.com/raqlol/ 
The final release will be added to my portfolio site at http://raqlol.com
